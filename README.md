The main goal of this project is to create a software application that employs Huffman Coding to compress text files. This application takes a text file as input and reduces its size through compression, allowing users to save the compressed version. Additionally, it offers the functionality to decompress the file back to its original form. The application also includes an extra feature: it can compress a sequence of alphabetic characters into a binary sequence with a significantly smaller size than the original. This compressed binary sequence can then be transmitted over a network or saved in a file for future decompression.

How to use it, and how does it operate?

To utilize this application, follow these steps:

Start by downloading all the project files from this branch and placing them in an appropriate folder.

Inside the "Executable" folder, you will find two files: "EncoderGUI.jar" and "Encoder.exe," which are executable versions of the application. You can choose either of these files to run the application.

Alternatively, you can run the project within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by executing the main method inside the "EncoderGUI" class.

Once the application is launched, you will have the option to browse for a file and select it as the input.

After selecting your file, specify the location where you want to save the compressed file.

Once all these settings are configured, click the "Compress" button to initiate the compression process.
